README

This matlab project aims to produce a consecutive morphing video from one face to another. 

The script ./main.m is the main script for demo. To produce your own video, you can change the source images in ./img and landmarks in ./get_landmarks.m. I have to admit that the landmark labeling and loading is quite troublesome: for now it needs users to check each coordinate and load manually. So, patience, my friend... If with enough time, I should make an interface for you to label feature points. The output frame images and video will be saved at ./frames and ./output.

One demo result is available online at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyt6HMkT_x0

The codes are programmed and tested in MATLAB R2013b-64bit on Mac OS X v10.9.5.

Hope you enjoy!
